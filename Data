Extracting data and Text Mining on TwitterÂ data.....

We all have the access to social media and since everything is now done online, the amount of data posted on social media sites has increased.
And we have different tools available to analyze the data and we can examine various socioeconomic factors using this data. So, in order to execute analysis, we must first collect/extract data, which is the first step in applying analysis techniques.
We are extracting data from Twitter using the Twitter APIs and Tweepy library.
To get access to Twitter APIs you need to have a Twitter developer account(Visit the Twitter developer site at dev.twitter.com) because the developer account can only give you the required credentials required to call the Twitter API.
Credentials are: Api_key, Api_secret, Access_token, Access_token_secret;
